description: We often speak of Theosophy as not in itself a religion, but the truth
  which lies behind all religions alike. That is so; yet, from another point of view,
  we may surely say that it is at once a philosophy, a religion and a science. It
  is a philosophy, because it puts plainly before us an explanation of the scheme
  of evolution of both the souls and the bodies contained in our solar system. It
  is a religion in so far as, having shown us the course of ordinary evolution, it
  also puts before us and advises a method of shortening that course, so that by conscious
  effort we may progress more directl.
